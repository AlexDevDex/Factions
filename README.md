# Factions
This is my first Minecraft Plugin.

The goal is to create a faction system that allows players to join one of two factions.

- They should not be able to attack players in there own faction
- A players faction should be clearly identifiable
- Should be persistent
- Possibly a gamemode with a initial "peace" time that gets disabled after a certain amount of time, last faction standing wins
